# Cloudfront KeyValueStore Redirect

The following project is a quick proof of concept of using a
Cloudfront distribution + Cloudfront function with the new
Cloudfront KeyValueStore to create edge ready redirect
application.

As Cloudfront KeyValueStore was released yesterday, its resource definitions do
not exist in IaC providers so I had to create that part via the console.
